# SuperTux: Alternate Universe
Tux is in his igloo one day, and he wakes up in an alternate universe where all the levels and the worldmaps are different, but the same world themes, somehow, and now, he must get to the mountain peaks, where he will have to face Nolok again and get out of the alternate universe!

This is a SuperTux 0.5.1 add-on.
