# cnub66 - New industrial tiles (they were in a pull request on the supertux repository, that pull request was closed though)

# DwarflinDeveloping - New Signs (they were in a a pull request on the supertux repository, that pull request was closed though)

# SuperTux Team - some new images and tiles apart from the hume2 tiles are from the media repository and also from actual supertux, although some are changed a little bit (the tropiballs are recolored and the smart tropiball and the bouncing tropiball are recolored + they have glasses to protect their eyes from the sand... that they are literally made out of)

# Pingus - there's some pingus assets here, but they are just placeholders, and i think only the ice pillar thingys are actually used in this add-on if you don't count anything in the strf files

# Stephen Groundwater / Slackstone - Forest World Adventure Pack + Various other assets from his opengameart page. Also some of the old SuperTux assets that are used here are also made by him.

# Charles Michael - Outro By Charles Michael

Pull Request of the SuperTux Repository named "Added beautiful outro music", I'm a bit scared to put a link to it because I don't really know how GitHub works.
