# Sefevi / EggsAndBakey - Sort of like the leader of the add-on

# Convival - Made a few levels

# Hume2 - The tiles used for some of these levels and the worldmap (they were in a pull reqeust on the supertux repository, that pull request was closed though)

# SuperTux Videos / Open Source Gaming - Some of the new tiles that aren't made by Hume2 or SuperTux Team such as the palm trees in images/decals/tropical and some worldmap-related stuff that has been added in the images/worldmap but not in worldmap2.strf yet

# SuperTux Team - some new images and tiles apart from the hume2 tiles are from the media repository and also from actual supertux, although some are changed a little bit (the tropiballs are recolored and the smart tropiball and the bouncing tropiball are recolored + they have glasses to protect their eyes from the sand... that they are literally made out of)

# Beau Buckley - most of the new custom music
